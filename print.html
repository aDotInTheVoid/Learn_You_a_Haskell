<h1><a class="header" href="#about-this-tutorial" id="about-this-tutorial">About this tutorial</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to <strong>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</strong> If you're reading this,
chances are you want to learn Haskell. Well, you've come to the right place, but
let's talk about this tutorial a bit first.</p>
<p>I decided to write this because I wanted to solidify my own knowledge of Haskell
and because I thought I could help people new to Haskell learn it from my
perspective. There are quite a few tutorials on Haskell floating around on the
internet. When I was starting out in Haskell, I didn't learn from just one
resource. The way I learned it was by reading several different tutorials and
articles because each explained something in a different way than the other did.
By going through several resources, I was able put together the pieces and it
all just came falling into place. So this is an attempt at adding another useful
resource for learning Haskell so you have a bigger chance of finding one you
like.</p>
<p>This tutorial is aimed at people who have experience in imperative programming
languages (C, C++, Java, Python …) but haven't programmed in a functional
language before (Haskell, ML, OCaml …). Although I bet that even if you don't
have any significant programming experience, a smart person such as yourself
will be able to follow along and learn Haskell.</p>
<p>The channel #haskell on the freenode network is a great place to ask questions
if you're feeling stuck. People there are extremely nice, patient and
understanding to newbies.</p>
<p>I failed to learn Haskell approximately 2 times before finally grasping it
because it all just seemed too weird to me and I didn't get it. But then once it
just &quot;clicked&quot; and after getting over that initial hurdle, it was pretty much
smooth sailing. I guess what I'm trying to say is: Haskell is great and if
you're interested in programming you should really learn it even if it seems
weird at first. Learning Haskell is much like learning to program for the first
time — it's fun! It forces you to think differently, which brings us to the next
section … </p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#so-whats-haskell" id="so-whats-haskell">So what's Haskell?</a></h1>
<p>Haskell is a <strong>purely functional programming language</strong>. In imperative languages
you get things done by giving the computer a sequence of tasks and then it
executes them. While executing them, it can change state. For instance, you set
variable <code>a</code> to 5 and then do some stuff and then set it to something else. You
have control flow structures for doing some action several times. In purely
functional programming you don't tell the computer what to do as such but rather
you tell it what stuff is. The factorial of a number is the product of all the
numbers from 1 to that number, the sum of a list of numbers is the first number
plus the sum of all the other numbers, and so on. You express that in the form
of functions. You also can't set a variable to something and then set it to
something else later. If you say that <code>a</code> is 5, you can't say it's something
else later because you just said it was 5. What are you, some kind of liar? So
in purely functional languages, a function has no side-effects. The only thing a
function can do is calculate something and return it as a result. At first, this
seems kind of limiting but it actually has some very nice consequences: if a
function is called twice with the same parameters, it's guaranteed to return the
same result. That's called referential transparency and not only does it allow
the compiler to reason about the program's behavior, but it also allows you to
easily deduce (and even prove) that a function is correct and then build more
complex functions by gluing simple functions together. </p>
<p>Haskell is <strong>lazy</strong>. That means that unless specifically told otherwise, Haskell
won't execute functions and calculate things until it's really forced to show
you a result. That goes well with referential transparency and it allows you to
think of programs as a series of <strong>transformations on data</strong>. It also allows
cool things such as infinite data structures. Say you have an immutable list of
numbers <code>xs = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]</code> and a function <code>doubleMe</code> which multiplies
every element by 2 and then returns a new list. If we wanted to multiply our
list by 8 in an imperative language and did <code>doubleMe(doubleMe(doubleMe(xs)))</code>,
it would probably pass through the list once and make a copy and then return it.
Then it would pass through the list another two times and return the result. In
a lazy language, calling <code>doubleMe</code> on a list without forcing it to show you the
result ends up in the program sort of telling you &quot;Yeah yeah, I'll do it
later!&quot;. But once you want to see the result, the first <code>doubleMe</code> tells the
second one it wants the result, now! The second one says that to the third one
and the third one reluctantly gives back a doubled 1, which is a 2. The second
one receives that and gives back 4 to the first one. The first one sees that and
tells you the first element is 8. So it only does one pass through the list and
only when you really need it. That way when you want something from a lazy
language you can just take some initial data and efficiently transform and mend
it so it resembles what you want at the end. </p>
<p>Haskell is <strong>statically typed</strong>. When you compile your program, the compiler
knows which piece of code is a number, which is a string and so on. That means
that a lot of possible errors are caught at compile time. If you try to add
together a number and a string, the compiler will whine at you. Haskell uses a
very good type system that has <strong>type inference</strong>. That means that you don't
have to explicitly label every piece of code with a type because the type system
can intelligently figure out a lot about it. If you say <code>a = 5 + 4</code>, you don't
have to tell Haskell that a is a number, it can figure that out by itself. Type
inference also allows your code to be more general. If a function you make takes
two parameters and adds them together and you don't explicitly state their type,
the function will work on any two parameters that act like numbers. </p>
<p>Haskell is <strong>elegant and concise</strong>. Because it uses a lot of high level
concepts, Haskell programs are usually shorter than their imperative
equivalents. And shorter programs are easier to maintain than longer ones and
have less bugs. </p>
<p>Haskell was made by some <strong>really smart guys</strong> (with PhDs). Work on Haskell
began in 1987 when a committee of researchers got together to design a kick-ass
language. In 2003 the Haskell Report was published, which defines a stable
version of the language. </p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#what-you-need-to-dive-in" id="what-you-need-to-dive-in">What you need to dive in</a></h1>
<p>A text editor and a Haskell compiler. You probably already have your favorite
text editor installed so we won't waste time on that. For the purposes of this
tutorial we'll be using GHC, the most widely used Haskell compiler. The best way
to get started is to download the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell
Platform</a>, which is basically Haskell with
batteries included.</p>
<p>GHC can take a Haskell script (they usually have a .hs extension) and compile it
but it also has an interactive mode which allows you to interactively interact
with scripts. Interactively. You can call functions from scripts that you load
and the results are displayed immediately. For learning it's a lot easier and
faster than compiling every time you make a change and then running the program
from the prompt. The interactive mode is invoked by typing in <code>ghci</code> at your
prompt. If you have defined some functions in a file called, say,
<code>myfunctions.hs</code>, you load up those functions by typing in <code>:l myfunctions</code> and
then you can play with them, provided <code>myfunctions.hs</code> is in the same folder
from which <code>ghci</code> was invoked. If you change the .hs script, just run <code>:l myfunctions</code> again or do <code>:r</code>, which is equivalent because it reloads the
current script. The usual workflow for me when playing around in stuff is
defining some functions in a .hs file, loading it up and messing around with
them and then changing the .hs file, loading it up again and so on. This is also
what we'll be doing here. </p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#ready-set-go" id="ready-set-go">Ready, set, go!</a></h1>
<p>Alright, let's get started! If you're the sort of horrible person who doesn't
read introductions to things and you skipped it, you might want to read the last
section in the introduction anyway because it explains what you need to follow
this tutorial and how we're going to load functions. The first thing we're going
to do is run ghc's interactive mode and call some function to get a very basic
feel for haskell. Open your terminal and type in <code>ghci</code>. You will be greeted
with something like this. </p>
<pre><code class="language-text">GHCi, version 6.8.2: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help  
Loading package base ... linking ... done.  
Prelude&gt;  
</code></pre>
<p>Congratulations, you're in GHCI! The prompt here is <code>Prelude&gt;</code> but because it
can get longer when you load stuff into the session, we're going to use <code>ghci&gt;</code>.
If you want to have the same prompt, just type in <code>:set prompt &quot;ghci&gt; &quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Here's some simple arithmetic. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; 2 + 15  
17  
ghci&gt; 49 * 100  
4900  
ghci&gt; 1892 - 1472  
420  
ghci&gt; 5 / 2  
2.5  
ghci&gt;  
</code></pre>
<p>This is pretty self-explanatory. We can also use several operators on one line
and all the usual precedence rules are obeyed. We can use parentheses to make
the precedence explicit or to change it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; (50 * 100) - 4999  
1  
ghci&gt; 50 * 100 - 4999  
1  
ghci&gt; 50 * (100 - 4999)  
-244950  
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, I know it's not but bear with me. A little pitfall to
watch out for here is negating numbers. If we want to have a negative number,
it's always best to surround it with parentheses. Doing <code>5 * -3</code> will make GHCI
yell at you but doing <code>5 * (-3)</code> will work just fine. </p>
<p>Boolean algebra is also pretty straightforward. As you probably know, <code>&amp;&amp;</code> means
a boolean <em>and</em>, <code>||</code> means a boolean <em>or</em>. <code>not</code> negates a <code>True</code> or a <code>False</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; True &amp;&amp; False  
False  
ghci&gt; True &amp;&amp; True  
True  
ghci&gt; False || True  
True   
ghci&gt; not False  
True  
ghci&gt; not (True &amp;&amp; True)  
False
</code></pre>
<p>Testing for equality is done like so. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; 5 == 5  
True  
ghci&gt; 1 == 0  
False  
ghci&gt; 5 /= 5  
False  
ghci&gt; 5 /= 4  
True  
ghci&gt; &quot;hello&quot; == &quot;hello&quot;  
True   
</code></pre>
<p>What about doing <code>5 + &quot;llama&quot;</code> or <code>5 == True</code>? Well, if we try the first
snippet, we get a big scary error message!</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">No instance for (Num [Char])  
arising from a use of `+' at &lt;interactive&gt;:1:0-9  
Possible fix: add an instance declaration for (Num [Char])  
In the expression: 5 + &quot;llama&quot;  
In the definition of `it': it = 5 + &quot;llama&quot;   
</code></pre>
<p>Yikes! What GHCI is telling us here is that <code>&quot;llama&quot;</code> is not a number and so it
doesn't know how to add it to <code>5</code>. Even if it wasn't <code>&quot;llama&quot;</code> but <code>&quot;four&quot;</code> or
<code>&quot;4&quot;</code>, Haskell still wouldn't consider it to be a number. <code>+</code> expects its left
and right side to be numbers. If we tried to do <code>True == 5</code>, GHCI would tell us
that the types don't match. Whereas <code>+</code> works only on things that are considered
numbers, <code>==</code> works on any two things that can be compared. But the catch is
that they both have to be the same type of thing. You can't compare apples and
oranges. We'll take a closer look at types a bit later. Note: you can do <code>5 + 4.0</code> because <code>5</code> is sneaky and can act like an integer or a floating-point
number. <code>4.0</code> can't act like an integer, so <code>5</code> is the one that has to adapt. </p>
<p>You may not have known it but we've been using functions now all along. For
instance, <code>*</code> is a function that takes two numbers and multiplies them. As
you've seen, we call it by sandwiching it between them. This is what we call an
<em>infix</em> function. Most functions that aren't used with numbers are <em>prefix</em>
functions. Let's take a look at them. </p>
<p>Functions are usually prefix so from now on we won't explicitly state that a
function is of the prefix form, we'll just assume it. In most imperative
languages functions are called by writing the function name and then writing its
parameters in parentheses, usually separated by commas. In Haskell, functions
are called by writing the function name, a space and then the parameters,
separated by spaces. For a start, we'll try calling one of the most boring
functions in Haskell. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; succ 8  
9   
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>succ</code> function takes anything that has a defined successor and returns that
successor. As you can see, we just separate the function name from the parameter
with a space. Calling a function with several parameters is also simple. The
functions <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> take two things that can be put in an order (like
numbers!). <code>min</code> returns the one that's lesser and <code>max</code> returns the one that's
greater. See for yourself: </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; min 9 10  
9  
ghci&gt; min 3.4 3.2  
3.2  
ghci&gt; max 100 101  
101   
</code></pre>
<p>However, if we wanted to get the successor of the product of numbers 9 and 10,
we couldn't write <code>succ 9 * 10</code> because that would get the successor of 9, which
would then be multiplied by 10. So 100. We'd have to write <code>succ (9 * 10)</code> to
get 91. </p>
<p>If a function takes two parameters, we can also call it as an infix function by
surrounding it with backticks. For instance, the <code>div</code> function takes two
integers and does integral division between them. Doing <code>div 92 10</code> results in 
a 9. But when we call it like that, there may be some confusion as to which number
is doing the division and which one is being divided. So we can call it as an
infix function by doing <code>92 `div` 10</code> and suddenly it's much clearer. </p>
<p>Lots of people who come from imperative languages tend to stick to the notion
that parentheses should denote function application. For example, in C, you use
parentheses to call functions like <code>foo()</code>, <code>bar(1)</code> or <code>baz(3, &quot;haha&quot;)</code>. Like
we said, spaces are used for function application in Haskell. So those functions
in Haskell would be <code>foo</code>, <code>bar 1</code> and <code>baz 3 &quot;haha&quot;</code>. So if you see something
like <code>bar (bar 3)</code>, it doesn't mean that <code>bar</code> is called with <code>bar</code> and <code>3</code> as
parameters. It means that we first call the function <code>bar</code> with <code>3</code> as the
parameter to get some number and then we call <code>bar</code> again with that number. In
C, that would be something like <code>bar(bar(3))</code>.</p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#babys-first-functions" id="babys-first-functions">Baby's first functions</a></h1>
<p>In the previous section we got a basic feel for calling functions. Now let's try
making our own! Open up your favorite text editor and punch in this function
that takes a number and multiplies it by two. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">doubleMe x = x + x  
</code></pre>
<p>Functions are defined in a similar way that they are called. The function name
is followed by parameters seperated by spaces. But when defining functions,
there's a <code>=</code> and after that we define what the function does. Save this as
<code>baby.hs</code> or something. Now navigate to where it's saved and run <code>ghci</code> from
there. Once inside GHCI, do <code>:l baby</code>. Now that our script is loaded, we can
play with the function that we defined. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; :l baby  
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( baby.hs, interpreted )  
Ok, modules loaded: Main.  
ghci&gt; doubleMe 9  
18  
ghci&gt; doubleMe 8.3  
16.6   
</code></pre>
<p>Because <code>+</code> works on integers as well as on floating-point numbers (anything
that can be considered a number, really), our function also works on any number.
Let's make a function that takes two numbers and multiplies each by two and then
adds them together. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">doubleUs x y = x*2 + y*2   
</code></pre>
<p>Simple. We could have also defined it as <code>doubleUs x y = x + x + y + y</code>. Testing
it out produces pretty predictable results (remember to append this function to
the <code>baby.hs</code> file, save it and then do <code>:l baby</code> inside GHCI). </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; doubleUs 4 9  
26  
ghci&gt; doubleUs 2.3 34.2  
73.0  
ghci&gt; doubleUs 28 88 + doubleMe 123  
478  
</code></pre>
<p>As expected, you can call your own functions from other functions that you made.
With that in mind, we could redefine <code>doubleUs</code> like this: </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">doubleUs x y = doubleMe x + doubleMe y   
</code></pre>
<p>This is a very simple example of a common pattern you will see throughout
Haskell. Making basic functions that are obviously correct and then combining
them into more complex functions. This way you also avoid repetition. What if
some mathematicians figured out that 2 is actually 3 and you had to change your
program? You could just redefine <code>doubleMe</code> to be <code>x + x + x</code> and since
<code>doubleUs</code> calls <code>doubleMe</code>, it would automatically work in this strange new
world where 2 is 3. </p>
<p>Functions in Haskell don't have to be in any particular order, so it doesn't
matter if you define <code>doubleMe</code> first and then <code>doubleUs</code> or if you do it the
other way around.</p>
<p>Now we're going to make a function that multiplies a number by 2 but only if
that number is smaller than or equal to 100 because numbers bigger than 100 are
big enough as it is! </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">doubleSmallNumber x = if x &gt; 100  
                        then x  
                        else x*2   
</code></pre>
<p>Right here we introduced Haskell's if statement. You're probably familiar with
if statements from other languages. The difference between Haskell's if
statement and if statements in imperative languages is that the else part is
mandatory in Haskell. In imperative languages you can just skip a couple of
steps if the condition isn't satisfied but in Haskell every expression and
function must return something. We could have also written that if statement in
one line but I find this way more readable. Another thing about the if statement
in Haskell is that it is an <em>expression</em>. An expression is basically a piece of
code that returns a value. <code>5</code> is an expression because it returns 5, <code>4 + 8</code> is
an expression, <code>x + y</code> is an expression because it returns the sum of <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>. Because the else is mandatory, an if statement will always return something
and that's why it's an expression. If we wanted to add one to every number
that's produced in our previous function, we could have written its body like
this. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">doubleSmallNumber' x = (if x &gt; 100 then x else x*2) + 1  
</code></pre>
<p>Had we omitted the parentheses, it would have added one only if <code>x</code> wasn't
greater than 100. Note the <code>'</code> at the end of the function name. That apostrophe
doesn't have any special meaning in Haskell's syntax. It's a valid character to
use in a function name. We usually use <code>'</code> to either denote a strict version of
a function (one that isn't lazy) or a slightly modified version of a function or
a variable. Because <code>'</code> is a valid character in functions, we can make a
function like this. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">conanO'Brien = &quot;It's a-me, Conan O'Brien!&quot;   
</code></pre>
<p>There are two noteworthy things here. The first is that in the function name we
didn't capitalize Conan's name. That's because functions can't begin with
uppercase letters. We'll see why a bit later. The second thing is that this
function doesn't take any parameters. When a function doesn't take any
parameters, we usually say it's a <em>definition</em> (or a <em>name</em>). Because we can't
change what names (and functions) mean once we've defined them, <code>conanO'Brien</code>
and the string <code>&quot;It's a-me, Conan O'Brien!&quot;</code> can be used interchangeably. </p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#an-intro-to-lists" id="an-intro-to-lists">An intro to lists</a></h1>
<p>Much like shopping lists in the real world, lists in Haskell are very useful.
It's the most used data structure and it can be used in a multitude of different
ways to model and solve a whole bunch of problems. Lists are SO awesome. In this
section we'll look at the basics of lists, strings (which are lists) and list
comprehensions. </p>
<p>In Haskell, lists are a <strong>homogenous</strong> data structure. It stores several
elements of the same type. That means that we can have a list of integers or a
list of characters but we can't have a list that has a few integers and then a
few characters. And now, a list! </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We can use the <code>let</code> keyword to define a name right in GHCI. Doing
<code>let a = 1</code> inside GHCI is the equivalent of writing <code>a = 1 in</code> a script and
then loading it. </p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; let lostNumbers = [4,8,15,16,23,42]  
ghci&gt; lostNumbers  
[4,8,15,16,23,42]  
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, lists are denoted by square brackets and the values in the lists
are separated by commas. If we tried a list like <code>[1,2,'a',3,'b','c',4]</code>,
Haskell would complain that characters (which are, by the way, denoted as a
character between single quotes) are not numbers. Speaking of characters,
strings are just lists of characters. <code>&quot;hello&quot;</code>is just syntactic sugar for
<code>['h','e','l','l','o']</code>. Because strings are lists, we can use list functions on
them, which is really handy. </p>
<p>A common task is putting two lists together. This is done by using the <code>++</code>
operator. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; [1,2,3,4] ++ [9,10,11,12]  
[1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12]  
ghci&gt; &quot;hello&quot; ++ &quot; &quot; ++ &quot;world&quot;  
&quot;hello world&quot;  
ghci&gt; ['w','o'] ++ ['o','t']  
&quot;woot&quot;

<p>Watch out when repeatedly using the <code>++</code> operator on long strings. When you put
together two lists (even if you append a singleton list to a list, for
instance: <code>[1,2,3] ++ [4]</code>), internally, Haskell has to walk through the whole
list on the left side of <code>++</code>. That's not a problem when dealing with lists
that aren't too big. But putting something at the end of a list that's fifty
million entries long is going to take a while. However, putting something at
the beginning of a list using the <code>:</code> operator (also called the cons operator)
is instantaneous. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; 'A':&quot; SMALL CAT&quot;  
&quot;A SMALL CAT&quot;  
ghci&gt; 5:[1,2,3,4,5]  
[5,1,2,3,4,5]
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how <code>:</code> takes a number and a list of numbers or a character and a list
of characters, whereas <code>++</code> takes two lists. Even if you're adding an element
to the end of a list with <code>++</code>, you have to surround it with square brackets so
it becomes a list. </p>
<p><code>[1,2,3]</code> is actually just syntactic sugar for <code>1:2:3:[]</code>. <code>[]</code> is an empty
list. If we prepend <code>3</code> to it, it becomes <code>[3]</code>. If we prepend <code>2</code> to that, it
becomes <code>[2,3]</code>, and so on. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <code>[]</code>, <code>[[]]</code> and <code>[[],[],[]]</code> are all different things. The first
one is an empty list, the seconds one is a list that contains one empty list,
the third one is a list that contains three empty lists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you want to get an element out of a list by index, use <code>!!</code>. The indices
start at 0.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; &quot;Steve Buscemi&quot; !! 6  
'B'  
ghci&gt; [9.4,33.2,96.2,11.2,23.25] !! 1  
33.2  
</code></pre>
<p>But if you try to get the sixth element from a list that only has four elements,
you'll get an error so be careful!</p>
<p>Lists can also contain lists. They can also contain lists that contain lists
that contain lists … </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; let b = [[1,2,3,4],[5,3,3,3],[1,2,2,3,4],[1,2,3]]  
ghci&gt; b  
[[1,2,3,4],[5,3,3,3],[1,2,2,3,4],[1,2,3]]  
ghci&gt; b ++ [[1,1,1,1]]  
[[1,2,3,4],[5,3,3,3],[1,2,2,3,4],[1,2,3],[1,1,1,1]]  
ghci&gt; [6,6,6]:b  
[[6,6,6],[1,2,3,4],[5,3,3,3],[1,2,2,3,4],[1,2,3]]  
ghci&gt; b !! 2  
[1,2,2,3,4]   
</code></pre>
<p>The lists within a list can be of different lengths but they can't be of
different types. Just like you can't have a list that has some characters and
some numbers, you can't have a list that has some lists of characters and some
lists of numbers.</p>
<p>Lists can be compared if the stuff they contain can be compared. When using <code>&lt;</code>,
<code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&gt;=</code> to compare lists, they are compared in lexicographical order.
First the heads are compared. If they are equal then the second elements are
compared, etc.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; [3,2,1] &gt; [2,1,0]  
True  
ghci&gt; [3,2,1] &gt; [2,10,100]  
True  
ghci&gt; [3,4,2] &gt; [3,4]  
True  
ghci&gt; [3,4,2] &gt; [2,4]  
True  
ghci&gt; [3,4,2] == [3,4,2]  
True  
</code></pre>
<p>What else can you do with lists? Here are some basic functions that operate on
lists. </p>
<p><strong><code>head</code></strong> takes a list and returns its head. The head of a list is basically
its first element. </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; head [5,4,3,2,1]  
5   
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>tail</code></strong> takes a list and returns its tail. In other words, it chops off a
list's head.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; tail [5,4,3,2,1]  
[4,3,2,1]   
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>last</code></strong> takes a list and returns its last element.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; last [5,4,3,2,1]  
1   
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>init</code></strong> takes a list and returns everything except its last element.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; init [5,4,3,2,1]  
[5,4,3,2]   
</code></pre>
<p>If we think of a list as a monster, here's what's what.</p>
<p><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/lyah/listmonster.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>But what happens if we try to get the head of an empty list?</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; head []  
*** Exception: Prelude.head: empty list  
</code></pre>
<p>Oh my! It all blows up in our face! If there's no monster, it doesn't have a
head. When using <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>last</code> and <code>init</code>, be careful not to use them
on empty lists. This error cannot be caught at compile time so it's always good
practice to take precautions against accidentally telling Haskell to give you
some elements from an empty list. </p>
<p><strong><code>length</code></strong> takes a list and returns its length, obviously.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; length [5,4,3,2,1]  
5  
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>null</code></strong> checks if a list is empty. If it is, it returns <code>True</code>, otherwise it
returns <code>False</code>. Use this function instead of <code>xs == []</code> (if you have a list called <code>xs</code>)</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; null [1,2,3]  
False  
ghci&gt; null []  
True  
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>reverse</code></strong> reverses a list.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; reverse [5,4,3,2,1]  
[1,2,3,4,5]  
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>take</code></strong> takes number and a list. It extracts that many elements from the
beginning of the list. Watch.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; take 3 [5,4,3,2,1]  
[5,4,3]  
ghci&gt; take 1 [3,9,3]  
[3]  
ghci&gt; take 5 [1,2]  
[1,2]  
ghci&gt; take 0 [6,6,6]  
[]  
</code></pre>
<p>See how if we try to take more elements than there are in the list, it just
returns the list. If we try to take 0 elements, we get an empty list.</p>
<p><strong><code>drop</code></strong> works in a similar way, only it drops the number of elements from the beginning of a list.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; drop 3 [8,4,2,1,5,6]  
[1,5,6]  
ghci&gt; drop 0 [1,2,3,4]  
[1,2,3,4]  
ghci&gt; drop 100 [1,2,3,4]  
[]   
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>maximum</code></strong> takes a list of stuff that can be put in some kind of order and
returns the biggest element.</p>
<p><strong><code>minimum</code></strong> returns the smallest.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; minimum [8,4,2,1,5,6]  
1  
ghci&gt; maximum [1,9,2,3,4]  
9   
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>sum</code></strong> takes a list of numbers and returns their sum.</p>
<p><strong><code>product</code></strong> takes a list of numbers and returns their product.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; sum [5,2,1,6,3,2,5,7]  
31  
ghci&gt; product [6,2,1,2]  
24  
ghci&gt; product [1,2,5,6,7,9,2,0]  
0   
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>elem</code></strong> takes a thing and a list of things and tells us if that thing is an
element of the list. It's usually called as an infix function because it's
easier to read that way.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; 4 `elem` [3,4,5,6]  
True  
ghci&gt; 10 `elem` [3,4,5,6]  
False  
</code></pre>
<p>Those were a few basic functions that operate on lists. We'll take a look at more list functions <a href="01_starting_out//06_modules/02_data_list.html">later</a></p>

<h1><a class="header" href="#texas-ranges" id="texas-ranges">Texas ranges</a></h1>
<p>What if we want a list of all numbers between 1 and 20? Sure, we could just type
them all out but obviously that's not a solution for gentlemen who demand
excellence from their programming languages. Instead, we'll use ranges. Ranges
are a way of making lists that are arithmetic sequences of elements that can be
enumerated. Numbers can be enumerated. One, two, three, four, etc. Characters
can also be enumerated. The alphabet is an enumeration of characters from A to
Z. Names can't be enumerated. What comes after &quot;John&quot;? I don't know. </p>
<p>To make a list containing all the natural numbers from 1 to 20, you just write
<code>[1..20]</code>. That is the equivalent of writing
<code>[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]</code> and there's no difference
between writing one or the other except that writing out long enumeration
sequences manually is stupid.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; [1..20]  
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]  
ghci&gt; ['a'..'z']  
&quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;  
ghci&gt; ['K'..'Z']  
&quot;KLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;   
</code></pre>
<p>Ranges are cool because you can also specify a step. What if we want all even
numbers between 1 and 20? Or every third number between 1 and 20? </p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; [2,4..20]  
[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]  
ghci&gt; [3,6..20]  
[3,6,9,12,15,18]   
</code></pre>
<p>It's simply a matter of separating the first two elements with a comma and then
specifying what the upper limit is. While pretty smart, ranges with steps aren't
as smart as some people expect them to be. You can't do <code>[1,2,4,8,16..100]</code> and
expect to get all the powers of 2. Firstly because you can only specify one
step. And secondly because some sequences that aren't arithmetic are ambiguous
if given only by a few of their first terms. </p>
<p>To make a list with all the numbers from 20 to 1, you can't just do <code>[20..1]</code>,
you have to do <code>[20,19..1]</code>.</p>
<p>Watch out when using floating point numbers in ranges! Because they are not
completely precise (by definition), their use in ranges can yield some pretty
funky results.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; [0.1, 0.3 .. 1]  
[0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.8999999999999999,1.0999999999999999]  
</code></pre>
<p>My advice is not to use them in list ranges.</p>
<p>You can also use ranges to make infinite lists by just not specifying an upper
limit. Later we'll go into more detail on infinite lists. For now, let's examine
how you would get the first 24 multiples of 13. Sure, you could do
<code>[13,26..24*13]</code>. But there's a better way: <code>take 24 [13,26..]</code>. Because Haskell
is lazy, it won't try to evaluate the infinite list immediately because it would
never finish. It'll wait to see what you want to get out of that infinite lists.
And here it sees you just want the first 24 elements and it gladly obliges. </p>
<p>A handful of functions that produce infinite lists:</p>
<p><strong><code>cycle</code></strong> takes a list and cycles it into an infinite list. If you just try to display the result, it will go on forever so you have to slice it off somewhere.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; take 10 (cycle [1,2,3])  
[1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1]  
ghci&gt; take 12 (cycle &quot;LOL &quot;)  
&quot;LOL LOL LOL &quot;   
</code></pre>
<p><strong><code>repeat</code></strong> takes an element and produces an infinite list of just that element. It's like cycling a list with only one element.</p>
<pre><code class="language-haskell">ghci&gt; take 10 (repeat 5)  
[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]  
</code></pre>
<p>Although it's simpler to just use the <strong><code>replicate</code></strong> function if you want some number of the same element in a list. <code>replicate 3 10</code> returns <code>[10,10,10]</code>.</p>
